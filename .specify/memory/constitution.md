# AI-driven Technical Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-Driven Technical Book Accuracy
Accuracy and correctness in all technical explanations. All technical content must be factually correct, verified against official documentation, and include working code examples that have been tested.

### Clarity for Intermediate Developers
Content must be clear and accessible for intermediate-level software developers. Explanations should avoid unnecessary jargon and provide context for complex concepts to ensure understanding.

### Progressive Learning Structure
Chapter complexity must increase gradually to support progressive learning. Each chapter builds on previous concepts without overwhelming readers with too many new ideas simultaneously.

### Practical Implementation-First Approach
Focus on practical, implementation-first approach rather than theoretical discussion. Each concept should include real working examples that readers can follow and implement independently.

### Human Review of AI Content
All AI-generated content must undergo human review before publication. This ensures quality, accuracy, and alignment with educational goals while maintaining professional standards.

### Docusaurus GitHub Pages Publishing
Content must be optimized for Docusaurus structure and deployment on GitHub Pages. All documentation format and organization should support the chosen publishing platform.

## Content Requirements

Each chapter must include code examples, explanations, and references. GitHub-linked source code where applicable, all AI models used must be acknowledged, content must support future updates and versioning, and documentation format optimized for Docusaurus structure. Project-first teaching approach with real working examples preferred over theoretical discussion. Hands-on tasks included per section with no unexplained terminology. Visuals/diagrams recommended when necessary.

## Structural Guidelines

Each chapter must contain: Summary, Learning goals, Core concepts, Implementation section, Additional resources, and Quiz or reflection questions. This structure ensures consistent educational quality across all content.

## Tooling Requirements

Content must be written using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code, follow a Markdown-first pipeline, be built using Docusaurus, and deployed on GitHub Pages. All tooling choices must support the educational mission and technical requirements.

## Writing Constraints

Tone must be educational and professional for an audience of intermediate software developers. Reading clarity should target 8th–12th grade level with avoidance of speculative or unverified claims. All content must be fact-checked against reliable sources.

## Sources

Acceptable sources include: Official documentation, Academic or peer-reviewed sources, Developer blogs, and Open-source documentation. Unverified social media sources must be avoided.

## Success Criteria

Docusaurus site builds and deploys successfully on GitHub Pages. All chapters follow Spec-Kit specification. Code examples function as written. Logical, progressive learning flow maintained. Zero unexplained jargon. Readers can independently follow and implement examples.

## Governance

All content must comply with these constitutional principles. Amendments require documentation of the change, approval process, and migration plan for existing content. All reviews and PRs must verify constitutional compliance. Complexity must be justified with clear educational benefit. Use this constitution as the primary guidance for all content creation and development decisions.
