# Physical AI Fundamentals

## Sensory Integration

Physical AI systems rely on multiple sensory modalities to understand their environment:

- Visual perception for spatial awareness
- Tactile feedback for manipulation
- Auditory processing for environmental understanding
- Proprioception for self-awareness
- Force/torque sensing for interaction

## Motor Control

The motor control aspect of Physical AI involves:
- Trajectory planning and execution
- Force control for safe interaction
- Adaptive control for changing environments
- Coordination of multiple actuators

## Learning in Physical Systems

Physical AI systems employ various learning approaches:
- Reinforcement learning for motor skill acquisition
- Imitation learning from human demonstrations
- Self-supervised learning from environmental interaction
- Transfer learning between simulation and reality

## Challenges

Physical AI faces unique challenges:
- Sample efficiency in real-world learning
- Safety during exploration
- Real-time performance requirements
- Simulation-to-reality transfer
