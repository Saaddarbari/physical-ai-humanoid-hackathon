# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where intelligence is not just abstract computation but is deeply integrated with physical interaction and real-world dynamics.

## Core Concepts

Physical AI encompasses systems that understand, interact with, and adapt to the physical world in real-time. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must contend with:
- Real-time constraints
- Physical laws and dynamics
- Sensory-motor coordination
- Embodied cognition
- Environmental uncertainty

## Key Principles

- **Embodiment**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Real-time Processing**: Systems must respond within physical time constraints
- **Adaptability**: Ability to adjust behavior based on physical feedback
- **Safety**: Ensuring safe interaction with humans and environment

## Applications

Physical AI finds applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, haptic interfaces, and other domains where digital intelligence must interact with the physical world.
