# AI-Robot Brain

The AI-Robot Brain module covers perception, navigation, and AI integration that enable humanoid robots to understand their environment and make intelligent decisions.

## Learning Goals

- Implement perception systems for environment understanding
- Design navigation and path planning for bipedal humanoids
- Understand sim-to-real transfer techniques for real-world deployment

## Core Concepts

- **Perception Systems**: Processing sensor data to understand the environment
- **Navigation and Path Planning**: Planning and executing movement in complex environments
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Techniques for applying simulation-trained models to real robots

## Implementation Section

This module includes practical examples of perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac, with hands-on exercises to create your own AI-powered robot behaviors.

## Additional Resources
