# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook covers the full stack of humanoid robotics development, from robot communication architecture to AI integration, using a simulation-first approach with sim-to-real transfer techniques.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of humanoid robotics and embodied intelligence
- Learn the three main components: Robotic Nervous System, Digital Twin, and AI-Robot Brain
- Gain practical experience with ROS 2, Gazebo simulation, and NVIDIA Isaac
- Complete an end-to-end capstone project with voice command processing and object manipulation

## Core Concepts

- **Embodied Intelligence**: The connection between digital AI models and real-world hardware
- **Robot Communication Architecture**: ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Simulation and Real-World Integration**: Techniques for sim-to-real transfer
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Processing voice commands to physical actions

## Implementation Section

This textbook takes a practical, implementation-first approach. Each concept is accompanied by working examples and hands-on exercises that you can implement independently.
