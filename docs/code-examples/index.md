# Code Examples for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This chapter provides comprehensive, testable, and reproducible code examples for all concepts covered in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Learning Goals

- Access working code examples for each concept
- Understand implementation patterns and best practices
- Reproduce examples for hands-on learning
- Build upon examples for custom applications

## Core Concepts

- **Reproducible Examples**: Code that can be run and tested independently
- **Implementation Patterns**: Best practices for robotics development
- **Testing Approaches**: How to validate code examples
- **Modular Design**: Examples designed for easy integration

## Implementation Section

This section contains complete, working code examples for all major concepts covered in the textbook, organized by module:

1. **ROS 2 Examples**: Basic and advanced ROS 2 programming patterns
2. **Gazebo Simulation Examples**: Physics simulation and environment creation
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Examples**: Perception and navigation systems
4. **Python Robotics Examples**: General robotics programming patterns
5. **Voice-Language-Action Examples**: VLA system implementation

Each example includes:
- Complete, runnable code
- Detailed explanations
- Testing instructions
- Integration guidance
