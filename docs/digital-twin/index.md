# Digital Twin

The Digital Twin module focuses on creating accurate simulation environments that mirror real-world robotics systems, enabling safe and cost-effective development and testing.

## Learning Goals

- Build physics simulation environments using Gazebo
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
- Create visualization and human-robot interaction interfaces

## Core Concepts

- **Physics Simulation**: Accurate modeling of real-world physics for robot testing
- **Sensor Simulation**: Creating realistic sensor data for development and training
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing interfaces for controlling and monitoring robots

## Implementation Section

This module includes practical examples of Gazebo simulation environments, with hands-on exercises to create your own physics worlds and sensor systems.
