# Robotic Nervous System

The Robotic Nervous System forms the foundation of humanoid robotics, providing the communication architecture that enables different components to work together seamlessly.

## Learning Goals

- Understand ROS 2 architecture: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Implement programming integration for robotics using Python
- Create and work with robot description models (URDF)

## Core Concepts

- **ROS 2 Communication Patterns**: How different components communicate using nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Programming Integration**: Using rclpy for Python-based robotics development
- **Robot Description**: Understanding URDF and robot modeling techniques

## Implementation Section

This module includes practical examples of ROS 2 communication patterns, with hands-on exercises to create your own nodes and communication systems.
