# Capstone Project: Voice-Controlled Object Manipulation

The capstone project integrates all three modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot that can respond to voice commands and manipulate objects in its environment.

## Learning Goals

- Integrate all three textbook modules into a cohesive system
- Implement Voice-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques for real-world execution

## Core Concepts

- **System Integration**: Connecting ROS 2 communication, simulation, and AI perception
- **Voice Command Processing**: Converting speech to actionable robot commands
- **Object Manipulation**: Planning and executing physical interactions with objects

## Implementation Section

This project combines all concepts learned in the textbook into a complete, end-to-end system that demonstrates the full potential of humanoid robotics.
